Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management

### Project Summary for GitHub: **Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management**

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to optimize portfolio management decisions using a custom environment. The objective is to allow an agent to dynamically allocate portfolio weights across multiple stocks, aiming to maximize returns while considering transaction costs and risk management. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key technical components:

#### 1. **Stock Price Data Simulation**
The project begins with the simulation of stock price data for five different stocks. The data is generated using random walk models over a period of 1,000 days. This dataset serves as a proxy for real-world financial data, providing the foundation for training and testing the reinforcement learning agent.

#### 2. **Custom Portfolio Management Environment**
A custom environment, `PortfolioEnv`, is developed using the Gymnasium framework. The environment is tailored to the portfolio management problem, with the following key features:
- **State Space**: Observations consist of current stock prices at each time step.
- **Action Space**: The agent decides portfolio weights for each stock, which dictate the proportion of the total portfolio allocated to each asset.
- **Reward Function**: The reward structure considers both portfolio returns and transaction costs, with penalties for overly concentrated positions (i.e., high-risk portfolios).
- **Risk Management**: The environment imposes penalties for portfolios that allocate more than 50% to any single stock, promoting diversification.
- **Termination**: The environment runs for the length of the stock price dataset, and an episode terminates when the dataset is fully traversed.

#### 3. **Agent Training using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to train the agent. Key technical aspects of the training process include:
- **Algorithm Choice**: PPO is a robust policy-gradient method commonly used in continuous action spaces, which suits the portfolio management problem.
- **Model Setup**: The agent is trained using Stable-Baselines3, a popular library for reinforcement learning, on the custom `PortfolioEnv` environment.
- **Training Process**: The agent is trained over 10,000 time steps. During each step, the agent learns to optimize the portfolio allocation based on observed stock prices and feedback from the environment.

#### 4. **Evaluation and Testing**
After training, the model is evaluated by simulating portfolio decisions over a 1,000-step period. The agent predicts actions based on stock price observations, and the environment provides feedback on portfolio performance. Termination occurs when the stock price data runs out or when the episode ends.

#### 5. **Future Enhancements**
Possible future directions include:
- **Using Real Stock Data**: Integrating real-world financial data for a more practical application of the agent.
- **Alternative RL Algorithms**: Experimenting with other RL methods, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), to compare performance.
- **Incorporating Additional Market Factors**: Adding features such as market sentiment, volatility, or macroeconomic indicators to enhance decision-making.

This project offers a solid foundation for applying reinforcement learning techniques to real-world portfolio management problems. The custom environment allows for flexible experimentation with various RL models, while the modular design facilitates future enhancements and integration of real data.
